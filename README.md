2.  **Install:** Follow the installation instructions specific to macOS or Windows.
3.  **Convert:**

    * **Single Image:** Drag and drop a single image file onto the application window or use the file selection dialog.
    * **Bulk Conversion:** Drag and drop an entire folder containing images or select multiple image files.
4.  **Configure:** (Optional) Adjust the output format and desired dimensions before starting the conversion.
5.  **Process:** Click the "Convert" button to begin the image conversion and optimization process.
6.  **Output:** Your converted images will be saved in a designated output folder (configurable within the application).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning for macOS Users

If you encounter a message saying the app can't be opened because it is not signed by Apple, macOS might block it. Don't worry, it's safe to open it anyway. To open it anyway, just follow these steps:

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Details

This project leverages the power of Flutter to provide a seamless cross-platform experience. Key aspects of the implementation include:

* **Image Processing Libraries:** Utilizing robust Flutter packages for image decoding, encoding, and manipulation to ensure high-quality conversions and resizing.
* **Native Integration:** Employing platform-specific code (where necessary) to handle file system interactions and provide a native-like feel on both macOS and Windows.
* **Asynchronous Operations:** Implementing asynchronous tasks to ensure the application remains responsive, especially during bulk image processing.
* **User Interface:** Building a clean and intuitive user interface with Flutter's widget system, focusing on ease of use and efficient workflows.

## üí° Future Implementations

We're constantly working to improve ImageConverter Pro and bring even more powerful features. Here's a glimpse of what's on our roadmap:

* **Image Compression Control:** Allow users to adjust the compression level for different output formats to fine-tune file sizes and quality.
* **Watermarking:** Add the ability to apply watermarks (text or image) to converted images.
* **More Output Formats:** Explore support for additional image formats like TIFF, GIF, and HEIF.
* **Advanced Resizing Options:** Implement more sophisticated resizing algorithms and options for maintaining aspect ratios or fitting within specific dimensions.
* **Metadata Handling:** Provide options to preserve, remove, or edit image metadata (EXIF, IPTC, XMP).
* **Preset Configurations:** Allow users to save and load frequently used conversion settings as presets.
* **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** Offer a command-line interface for advanced users and scripting automation.
* **Integration with Cloud Services:** Explore potential integrations with cloud storage services for seamless image management.
